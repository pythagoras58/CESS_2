Create a superclass Vehicle with fields for the number 
of wheels and a method to display information about the vehicle. 
Then, create two subclasses, Car and Bike, that inherit from Vehicle.
Each subclass should have an additional field specific to that type of vehicle 
(e.g., numberOfDoors for Car and hasCarrier for Bike). 
Implement methods in each subclass to display their specific information. 
Finally, create a main method to instantiate objects of Car and Bike, and display their information.

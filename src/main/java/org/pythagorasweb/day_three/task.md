In this task, you will create a simple 
contact management system using ArrayList, 
LinkedList, and HashMap. 
The system will allow users to add, remove, and search for contacts. 
Each contact will have a name and a phone number.

Requirements:
ArrayList: Use an ArrayList to store a list of contact names.
LinkedList: Use a LinkedList to store a list of phone numbers 
            corresponding to the contact names.
HashMap: Use a HashMap to store the contact names as keys and phone 
         numbers as values for fast lookups.
Steps:
Create a class Contact to represent a contact 
        with a name and a phone number.
Create a ContactManager class to manage the contacts 
        using ArrayList, LinkedList, and HashMap.

Implement methods to add, remove, and search for contacts.
